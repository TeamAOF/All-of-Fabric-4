{
  // Welcome to The Graveyard Config!
 //
 // Here, you can disable structures to spawn, change their chance of spawning, change their separation and also change their salt.
 // Additionally, you can turn the graveyard fog particles on and set the chance of spawning them (higher numbers = lower chance of spawning).
 // You can also turn off the cartographer map trade for the large graveyard. As minecraft structure search algorithm isn't the fastest, loading the map can cause lag.
 // Graveyard fog particles spawn in graveyards and add an atmospheric and spooky element while exploring.
 //
 // To disable a structure to spawn, simply go to the corresponding entry and set `enabled` to false.
 //
 // The Graveyard uses the vanilla structure spawning system. That is -
 // - Separation is the minimum chunks between structures
 // - Spacing is the average chunks between structures (Spacing value needs to be higher than Separation value!)
 // - Salt is a special field that gives structures unique spawning positions. (Only change if you know what you are doing!)
 //
 // Notice: reducing the generation settings will increase the risk of structures overlapping. Especially jigsaw structures are unpredictable!
